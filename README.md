# cricket-centurions
Program to find out which cricketer has the highest average of innings when they've scored a century. i.e. who 'kicks on' best and goes big.


## `playerSearch`
This program is passed a player's name (e.g. Chris Gayle) from the command line and returns the player ID used on HowStat. This ID is then used to scrape information for stats.

## `playerKickOn`
This program is passed a player's name (e.g. Chris Gayle) from the command line and returns the total runs scored by the player in the centurion innings and their average across those innings. `playerSearch` is incorporated into the program
